## Overview

This project predicts the survival of passengers on the Titanic using logistic regression. The dataset used is the Titanic Dataset, which includes features such as passenger class, sex, age, number of siblings/spouses aboard, number of parents/children aboard, fare, and port of embarkation.

## Dependencies

To run this project, you need to install the following Python libraries:

- NumPy
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- scikit-learn
- IPython

## Installation

Install the necessary dependencies.

## For Example
## Installation

To install the specified packages (numpy, pandas, matplotlib, seaborn, scikit-learn, and ipython) , follow these steps:


1. *Set up a Virtual Environment*:

```bash
    python -m venv venv
```
 


2. *Activate the Virtual Environment*:
- On Windows:
        

```bash
venv\Scripts\activate
```

- On macOS/Linux:

```bash
source venv/bin/activate
```

    
3. *Install the Required Packages*:

```bash
 pip install numpy pandas matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn ipython 
```  

 


## Combined Script

Here is the combined script for all steps:


### Step 1: Set up a virtual environment


```bash
  python -m venv venv
```



### Step 2: Activate the virtual environment
#### For Windows:

```bash
  venv\Scripts\activate
```

### For macOS/Linux:
### source venv/bin/activate

#### Step 3: Install the required packages

```bash
  pip install numpy pandas matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn ipython
```

```bash
  pip install numpy pandas matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn ipython
```

### After running the above commands, your requirements.txt file will include entries similar to these (exact versions may vary):

```bash

ipython==8.4.0
matplotlib==3.5.2
numpy==1.22.4
pandas==1.4.2
scikit-learn==1.1.1
seaborn==0.11.2
```

This file ensures that the same versions of these packages can be installed in any environment by running:
